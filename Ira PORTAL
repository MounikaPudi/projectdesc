override websocketmessageBrokerConfig --> implement some methods
we need to implement some methods 
methods --> registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry stompEndpointRegistry) 
stompEndpointRegistry.addEndpoint("/ws")  - websocket created
.withSockJS(); --> these library used to create websocket
@Override 
public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry registry) {
registry.enableSimpleBroker("/topic")  --> we give the name as a topic for the messagebroker
we push the messages to the broker
registry.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes("/app") --> the prefix /app whatever websockets we provided
we have to add two annotations --> @Configuration, @EnableWebSocketMessageBrokerer

@Controller
public class userController{
@MessageMapping("/user")
@SendTo("/topic/user")
public UserResponse getUser(User user) {
return new UserResponse("hi" + user.getName());
}}

we send to the backend from the UI . and backend push the response via different topic which is using message broker 
and it is using the protocol called stomp(text oriented messaging protocol) 
use websockets to push the messages to the broker

the user can see the messages via websockets 

we created websocketconfiguration --> we created endpoint --> via which we can communicate our channel
inside that we created a topic --> simple broker --> text oriented messages protocol --> push the messags --> 
which is nothing but stomp --> we created destination prefix --> app 

we created user controller /user  --> websocket end point  we send it as user response to the particular topic
and that topic read by UI
intiate connection information to the backend 

var socket = new SockJS('/websocket-example')
stompClient = Stomp.over(socket)
